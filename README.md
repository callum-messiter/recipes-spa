# Recipes SPA (SubSec)

> A Vue.js project

## Dependencies

- NPM >= v5.2.0
- Node >= v8.9.3

## TODO

- Viewing the details of a single recipe. This might work by clicking one of the recipes, which would trigger navigation to a new screen: `/recipe/:recipeId`
- Allowing the user to select a max cooking time, rather than simply entering a string

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
